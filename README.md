## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

Nesting is possible in CSS. I heard it has been avail since CSS3, I just tried it and it worked 

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
    <div class="text-section">
        <div class="heading">
          <h1>Improve your front-end skills by building projects</h1>
        </div>
        <div class="para">
          <p>Scan the QR code to visit Frontend Mentor and take your coding skills to the next level</p>
        </div>
    </div>
```
```css
.text-section {
    padding: 20px;
    & .heading h1 {
        font-size: var(--font-size-1);
        font-weight: 700;
        letter-spacing: 1px;
        padding: 0px 20px;
    }
    & .para p {
        font-weight: 400;
        padding: 10px 30px;
    }
}
```
### Continued development

I'll have to focus more on calculation while styling, using semantic HTML and cleaner code in the future.
